## About the Project

This project was really fun going into it as my first paired programming exercise but when we finished the original version [HERE](https://github.com/Benzion-Jacob/coffee-project), I knew there was more I wanted to do with the code.

Taking everything back and structuring it so that the search object takes in a list object, we can then fill the list object with anything we want to sort out what is shown to the user. The search object make an appearance in some other projects I have on my GitHub, because I made it extendable to capture a form input and sort based on a parameter automatically.

### Background Rendering

The dynamic background is also a really nice achievement. I wanted to make a quick renderer using what I have learned making small games in HTML5 Canvas. The renderer takes in an image and a z-index so that it sorts out the layers before rendering takes place. the z-index effects how far away the parallax is displayed.
